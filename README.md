# Surface Mining Fix Mod \*\*ALPHA\*\*

## Features
- Azbantium Fist enchantment that allows faster surface mining dependant on power
- Seafloor Mining Rig item to mine underwater
- Azbantium Pickaxe item alternative to Azbantium Fist (off by default)
- Remove surface mining restriction altogether (off by default)
- Don't require all corners to be uncovered (off by default)
- Detailed configuration
- Ago's Mod Loader required

## Information

### Azbantium Fist (Enchantment)
Azbantium Fist works just like Wind of Ages (requires statuette, etc.) but is for the Magranon deity by default. The power directly relates to the chance you have to mine a slope down. Without the enchantment, you have a 25% chance. As the power increases, the chance goes up till you get to 100% at power 100.

### Seafloor Mining Rig (Item)
Seafloor Mining Rig acts like a dredge but is for mining. 
The ingredients are: 
- 5kg of iron lump
- 1kg of steel lump

Continue:
- 2kg of lead lump
- 1 thick rope
 
### Azbantium Pickaxe (Item)
Similar to a pickaxe, made exactly the same as one, but the ql of the pickaxe also decides the chance of lowering a rock slope. Off by default.

### Other features
You can enable 'alwaysLowerRockSlope' in the configs and any mining will always lower rock slope. Doing so will make AF and Azbantium Pickaxe useless.

You can enable 'noNeedToUnconverRock' in the configs and you will no longer need to uncover all rock tiles. This is an experimental feature and is known to convert some surrounding tiles into rock tiles. Enable at your own risk.

**Remember, this is an alpha, expect big changes and some bugs.**

## To Do (in no particular order)
- Make SMR hollow and work more like a dredge
- Suggest more features in the issues section! 
- ~~Better/more configuration~~ (done)
- ~~Item equivalent to Azbantium Pickaxe~~ (done)
- ~~Enchantment to be able to mine deeper under water or a dredge-like item but for rock~~ (Created item instead)
- ~~Limit enchantment so that it's the only one that is allowed~~ (done)
  - ~~Implemented: If the pickaxe already has WoA you won't be able to enchant, this is not the case the other way around; needs expansion.~~ (done)

Thanks ago for all your help and your great mod loader.
